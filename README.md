# archlinux-iso
Create a custom and updated arch iso with xfce live desktop (and optional archlinux-installer script, [later added])

This Script was tested and works for iso 2021.05.31

```bash
# Run the Script as Root
sudo ./create-arch-iso.sh
```
I will update this iso build over time to work for future isos.

Feel free to add Issues, if you get errors or find bugs.
